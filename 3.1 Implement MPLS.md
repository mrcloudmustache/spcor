* LDP sync is not enabled by default.
* With LDP sync the IGP will always choose the best and shortest path to the destination.
* When LDP sync is enabled the router will start advertising the highest cost on the effected link.
* Enable under the IGP 
* ```
  conf t
  router ospf 1
  mpls ldp sync
  ```
