## 3.1.a LDP Sync

* LDP sync is not enabled by default.
* With LDP sync the IGP will always choose the best and shortest path to the destination.
* When LDP sync is enabled the router IGP will start advertising the highest cost on the effected link.
* Enable under the IGP 
  * OSPF 
  * ```
    conf t
    router ospf 1
    mpls ldp sync
    ```
  * ISIS
  * ```
    router isis LDP
    interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0.504 address-family ipv4 unicast
    mpls ldp sync
    interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0.534
    ```

* Show commannds 
  *  show mpls ldp neighbor detail
  *  show mpls ldp igp sync
  *  show ip ospf database router 1.1.1.1 self-orginate
   *  Sync status Down: sync not achieved; peer reachable
   *  Sync status UP: sync achieved; peer reachable

**LDP Sync Lab**

* Create access-list that blocks TCP port 646 betweem LDP nieghbors.
* Clear LDP session between neighbors with ```clear mpls ldp neighbor <neighbor-ip-address>```
* The path becomes unlabled creating a routing black hole
