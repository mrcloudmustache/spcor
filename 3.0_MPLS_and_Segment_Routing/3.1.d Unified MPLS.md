## Unified MPLS

[Unified MPLS Cisco Site](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls/mpls/118846-config-mpls-00.html)

* Provides MPLS scalling by using multiple technologies
  * IGP (OSPF, ISIS)
  * LDP for the transport label
  * **BGP plus label** ```neighbor x.x.x.x send-label```
  * Use transport label inside the island
  * Use BGP between islands
  * IOS-XE ```neighbor x.x.x.x next-hop-self all```
  * IOS-XR ```ibgp policy out enforce-modifications```
* Solves the problem of a large IGP domain. 
* Creates multiple IGP processes or domains.
  * Connects domains using iBGP
 * There is no redistribution betwork IGP ASBRs instead you would use BGP iBGP to advertise the network.
 * You cannot advertise the same loopback in multiple routing processes. Must use BGP instead.
 * Only redistribute the ASBR looback into the IGP core.
